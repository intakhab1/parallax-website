 What is parallax effect?
 - Due to different distance between elements , the background content (i.e. an image) is appear to be  moving at a different speed(slower)     than the foreground content while scrolling. 
 - Parallax effect, it happens when the different elements of a page move at different speeds — creating a 3D depth effect.
 - Example: from a moving car , the building appear to move backward fast as compared to the sun due to diffence in distance from the eyes
